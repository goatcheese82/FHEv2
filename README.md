# Overview

This is a Web API built using ASP.NET Core 8.0. Its purpose is to create a backend for FHE assignments.

It is written in C# using ASP.NET Core 8.0

I have been wanting to create an application to display the week's FHE assignments for my children. This is a good way to keep track of who is doing what in our meetings.

# Development Environment

This software was written using Visual Studio Professional Version 17.8.3

I chose to write this using C#, since it is a language with which I am unfamiliar. I have learned a lot about syntax and convention.

- [C# Corner](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/building-a-powerful-asp-net-core-web-api-with-postgresql/) - I used this to figure out the PostGreSQL portion of the application.

# Future Work
